> I did not install additional controller, So I need to add a configuration file inside proxmox manually.

```bash 
ssh root@192.168.X.X

We want to use unique identifier of the hard drive, so that verify the unique serial number.
```bash
lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL
```
```bash
ls /dev/disk/by-id
```
```bash
qm set 100 -scsi /dev/disk/by-id/(Any drive that you want to use)
```

Create Periodic Snapshot Tasks

> TrueNAS snapshots are used to recover files or restore a system to a specific point in time
* Recover files

   Snapshots keep a history of files, allowing users to recover deleted or older files.  

* Restore a system

   Snapshots can be used to roll back a system to a specific point in time, such as after a catastrophic system or disk failure. 

* Protect data

   Snapshots can protect data from encryption or other factors that might cause data loss
