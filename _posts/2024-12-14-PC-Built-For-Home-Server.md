## New Machine Operating As a Home Server

### This machine is intended to be used as a home server, so my goal this time is to build a PC as cheaply and as well as possible.

* CPU - AMD Ryzen 5 5500 6 Core AM4 4.20GHz (AMD-V, No ECC Memory)
* GPU - MSI GT 710 2G DDR3 Low Profile Graphics Card
* Motherboard - Gigabyte B550M K mATX AM4 
* RAM - Crucial 8GBx2 3200MHz DDR4 
* Hard Drive - SSD Silicon Power 256GB PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD
* Power Supply - Cooler Master 650W 80+ Bronze 


> No ECC-Memory(A type of computer data storage that uses an error correction code (ECC) to detect and correct n-bit data corruption which occurs in memory) 
This server is for home server purposes only, there are no critical or sensitive data that I will store and manage.
